‚è≥ Backdated GitHub Commits ‚Äî Project Upload Guide

This project demonstrates how to add a local project to GitHub with backdated commit history. It uses a Python script that automatically commits files one by one, simulating activity over a period of time.

The end result is a visually unusual GitHub commit graph with ups and downs, even if the work was done offline or previously. You can set your desired start date and control how the activity shows up on your profile ‚Äî great for showcasing legacy work or building commit history naturally.

üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

üîÑ Steps:
	1.	Download this repo‚Äôs files (especially script.py).
	2.	Create a new local folder for your project (manually or using this command):

        <pre>
        ```
        mkdir your-project-name
        cd your-project-name
        git init
        ```
        </pre>

	3.	Move script.py into this folder.
	4.	Ignore script.py in your commits, and add the .gitignore with a past commit date using the following command on terminal:

        <pre>
        ```
        echo script.py >> .gitignore
        git add .gitignore
        GIT_AUTHOR_DATE="2023-05-31T12:00:00" GIT_COMMITTER_DATE="2023-05-31T12:00:00" git commit -m "Add .gitignore" 
        ```
        </pre>  

    5. 	5.	Move all your actual project files into this folder.
	6.	Open script.py and update the start_date (line 7) to when you want your commit history to begin.
	7.	Run the script:
        <pre>
        ```
        python script.py
        ```
        </pre> 

    8. 	Create a GitHub repo online (do not initialize it with README or anything).
	9.	Link your local folder to GitHub:

         <pre>
        ```
        git remote remove origin
        git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
        git push -u origin main
        ```
        </pre> 

üìà Result

Once pushed, your GitHub profile will reflect the full commit history with dates in the past ‚Äî creating a realistic and varied contribution graph. Useful for uploading and showcasing offline work as if it were done consistently over time!
